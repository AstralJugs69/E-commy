# PWA Icons

The following icon files need to be added to this directory:

- `icon-192x192.png` - A 192x192 pixel PNG icon for Android devices
- `icon-512x512.png` - A 512x512 pixel PNG icon for larger devices and high-resolution displays

These files are referenced in the PWA manifest configuration in `vite.config.ts` and are necessary for proper PWA functionality.

## Design Guidelines

- Use a consistent design that matches your brand identity
- Ensure the icons have a transparent background
- For best results, center the logo and leave padding around the edges
- Test the icons on different backgrounds to ensure visibility
